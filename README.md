HandyBatterySimulator
The HandyBatterySimulator is a simple console-based project that simulates the battery usage and charging process of a device. The program monitors the battery percentage as it drains from 100% to a critical level. At 20%, the user is prompted to enable a battery-saving mode. If the battery reaches 5%, the system automatically begins charging until the battery is fully recharged to 100%.

This project also serves as a small example to understand the functionality of while-loops in programming by simulating continuous battery monitoring and charging behavior.

Key Features:

Simulates battery usage in real-time, decreasing the battery percentage.
Prompts the user to activate energy-saving mode at 20% battery.
Automatically initiates battery charging at 5%, simulating a full charge back to 100%.
Goal: The goal of this project is to simulate battery management scenarios that can be applied to real-world devices, while providing a clear demonstration of how while-loops operate in a practical context.
