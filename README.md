HandyBatterySimulator

The HandyBatterySimulator is a simple console-based project that simulates the battery usage and charging process of a device. The program monitors the battery percentage as it drains from 100% to a critical level. At 20%, the user is prompted to enable a battery-saving mode. If the battery reaches 5%, the system automatically begins charging until the battery is fully recharged to 100%.

This project also serves as a small example to understand the functionality of while-loops in programming by simulating continuous battery monitoring and charging behavior.

Key Features:
1. Simulates battery usage in real-time, decreasing the battery percentage.
2. Prompts the user to activate energy-saving mode at 20% battery.
3. Automatically initiates battery charging at 5%, simulating a full charge back to 100%.

Goal: 
The goal of this project is to simulate battery management scenarios that can be applied to real-world devices, while providing a clear demonstration of how while-loops operate in a practical context.

Installation:
To run the HandyBatterySimulator locally:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MeTh7/HandyBatterySimulator.git
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project by pressing Ctrl + F5 or using the Run button in Visual Studio.

Usage:
1. The simulator starts with the battery at 100% and drains it in real-time.
2. At 20%, the system will prompt the user to activate a battery-saving mode.
3. If the battery reaches 5%, the system will automatically begin charging the battery back to 100%.
4. The simulation ends once the battery is fully charged.

Technologies used:
